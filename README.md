# Mob-Programming-Exercise
This repo serves to teach Mob Programming in conjunction with the slides. 

Exercise 1: 

"FizzBuzz!"
  Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz".
  
  Lets translate that to code!
Create a program that take in command line input and returns the following:
Fizz! When a number is divisible by 3.
Buzz! When a number is divisible by 5.
FizzBuzz! When a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
When none of those cases are present the program should return the input!
(Make it more challenging: If the input is non-numerical it should error appropriately.)
(Make it even more challenging: If the input is non-numerical, but the word is a valid number the program works as mentioned above.)

Don't forget to work in a TDD fashion, remember RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR (Need a brush up? *Click Here*) 

It's important to note that all team members must understand what the code is doing and how before this exercise can be considered a success. 
Role timing: 3 minutes per role.

Exercise 2: 

"Pig Latin"

*igpay atinlay siay unfay amegay!*

Pig Latin is a silly thing, but silly things can be fun to code! Make a program that takes in command line input and removes the first letter, placing it to the back of the word, then adds "ay". Punctuation should still remain. 

Timer: 5 minutes per role.

Exercise 3:

"Roman Numerals"

Take a command line input and turn this into its equilvalent roman numerals. Please work from 1 - 3000.

1 = I etc...

Timer: Team Decision
